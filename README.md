## Known Issues
1. **DOKER issue** outside doker works **Great** - in Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpContext(context) - context.Request.Cookies[CookieName] - can **not get** Token from Cookie - **added workaround** to keep token state
2. Masstransit messaging **working as intended** - If Lising is updated and OffersMS is down coresponding offers for the listing are Not updateted, when OffersMS comes up again coresponding offers are automatically updated. **But** in Messages Entity - IsPublished property is **always true !?**.
